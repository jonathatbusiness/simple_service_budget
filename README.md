# Simple Service Budget

****What is this project about?**

My friend needed something simple to fill up a Service Budget, save it in pdf and share it with customers, so I developed this project to study a bit more about javascript, HTML and CSS.

**What does this project?**

This is a simple Proposal for Internet Supplies, that is filled with some info like materials, services, quantities and values. There are some mathematical expressions that return the materials and services values. The user can add or remove lines according to the item's variety. After everything is done, the user can save it in a PDF file.

**The data can be stored?**

No. To keep it simple because of it's purpose, it doesn't store any data after the PDF saving or the page reload.

**What was used in this project?**

I made it using HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also used the HTML2PDF.js to generate PDF files from the page and Bootstrap Icons for the Instagram Icon.
